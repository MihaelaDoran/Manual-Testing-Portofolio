# Manual Testing Portofolio    
      
## Introduction 
      
The purpose of this Final Project is to put into practice all the information that I have acquired from the ITFactory Manual Testing course.  <br>   
The website that I have performed my majority of tests is [OrangeHRM](https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/web/index.php/dashboard/index) with 
the "User Management" and "Job" submenus. The requirements for this website can be found [here](https://www.orangehrm.com/assets/Files/Complete-Administrative-User-Guide.pdf?url=/Files/Complete-Administrative-User-Guide.pdf) and the tools that I have used for managing project and creating test cases are Jira Software and Zephyr  Squad. <br>  
For Rest API testing of [Simple Books](https://github.com/vdespa/introduction-to-postman-course/blob/main/simple-books-api.md) I have used Postman. <br>  
For creating and updating a database with its tables I have used MySQL Workbench tool. <br>
