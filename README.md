# Manual Testing Portofolio    
      
## Introduction 
      
The purpose of this Final Project is to put into practice all the information that I have acquired from the ITFactory Manual Testing course.  <br>   
The application that I have performed my majority of tests is [OrangeHRM](https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/web/index.php/dashboard/index) with 
the "User Management" and "Job" sections. The requirements for this application can be found [here](https://www.orangehrm.com/assets/Files/Complete-Administrative-User-Guide.pdf?url=/Files/Complete-Administrative-User-Guide.pdf) and the tools that I have used for managing project and creating test cases are Jira Software and Zephyr  Squad. <br>  
For Rest API testing of [Simple Books](https://github.com/vdespa/introduction-to-postman-course/blob/main/simple-books-api.md) I have used Postman. <br>  
For creating and updating a database with its tables I have used MySQL Workbench tool. <br>  
This project will be divided into 2 sections: [Testing Section](https://github.com/MihaelaDoran/Manual-Testing-Portofolio/blob/main/README.md#Testing-Section) and [SQL Section](https://github.com/MihaelaDoran/Manual-Testing-Portofolio/blob/main/README.md#SQL-Section). <br>  
## 1 Testing Section <br> 
### 1.1 Test Planning <br> 
The Test Plan is designed to describe all details of testing for the Admin Modul of the OrangeHRM application. <br> 
The plan identifies the items to be tested, the features to be tested, the types of testing to be performed, the personnel responsible for testing, the resources and schedule required to complete testing, and the risks associated with the plan. <br> 
#### 1.1.1 Roles assigned to the project and persons allocated <br> 
- Project manager - Grigore Manda
- Product owner - Marius Negrescu
- Software developer - Georgiana Dobre
- QA Engineer - Mihaela Doran <br> 
#### 1.1.2 Entry criteria defined <br> 
- functional specifications are defined
- roles needed for the project are allocated
- initial project risks were detected and mitigated
- test environment has been set-up and all other necessary resources such as tools and devices are available
- test cases are developed and ready <br> 
#### 1.1.3 Exit criteria defined <br> 
- all tests have been executed
- all the identified defects are corrected and closed
- deadline was reached
- no high priority or severity or critical bug has been left out
- all resolved bugs have been re-tested and approved by the QA team
- desired and sufficient coverage of the requirements and functionalities under the test
- exploratory regression testing must be performed on the Admin module, which includes the "User Management" and "Job" sections <br> 
#### 1.1.4 Test scope <br> 
- **Tests in scope:** All the feature of Admin module which were defined in software requirement specs need to be tested: functional testing, GUI testing
- **Tests not in scope:** performance testing, integration testing, compatibility testing with multiple browsers <br> 
#### 1.1.5 Risks detected <br> 
**Project risks:** 
- lack of experience of the QA team
- lack of clarity in requirements
- short deadline of Zephyr Squad trial
- unavailability of test environment
